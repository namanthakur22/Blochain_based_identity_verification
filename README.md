<h1>Blockchain-Powered Decentralized Employee Verification & Cross-Organizational Identity Assurance</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In a digitized world, ensuring the authenticity of credentials and affiliations has become crucial. This project aims to address these concerns by developing a Blockchain-Powered Decentralized Employee Verification & Cross-Organizational Identity Assurance system. The proposed system leverages blockchain technology for decentralization, transparency, and immutability, and integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) for efficient data extraction. The backend is powered by Django, with Tailwind CSS enhancing the frontend.</p>
